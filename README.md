# Generative Adversarial Network

In this repository, I will save the results of my models  related to generative models.

I have trained a model related to the cartoon image by using a Generative Adversarial Network. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a machine learning model where two networks, a generator and a discriminator, compete to create realistic data from random noise.
